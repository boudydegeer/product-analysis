# Quality Workflow - Product Analysis Platform

## Overview

Mandatory quality system to ensure minimum quality standards for all code changes in the Product Analysis Platform. This workflow applies to **ALL** code changes including new features, bug fixes, and refactoring tasks.

**Core Principle**: Quality is not negotiable. No task is complete until all quality gates pass.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. TDD Obligatorio (MUST)

Test-Driven Development is mandatory for all implementation work.

**Requirements**:
- Use `/test-driven-development` skill at the START of every implementation
- Follow the Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- Tests must be written BEFORE implementation code
- Coverage requirement: **90%+ mandatory**

**Why TDD?**
- Catches bugs early in development
- Ensures code is testable by design
- Provides living documentation
- Reduces debugging time
- Improves code quality and maintainability

### 2. Visual Verification (UI Changes)

All UI changes must be visually verified before completion.

**Process**:
1. Start frontend in dev or preview mode
2. Navigate to the modified component/page
3. Capture screenshot using Playwright
4. Review screenshot visually before completing task

**Required for**: All tasks that modify UI components, pages, or styling

**Command**:
```bash
npm run screenshot -- --url=http://localhost:5173/path
```

### 3. Mandatory Skills by Task Type

Different task types require different skill workflows.

#### New Feature
1. `/brainstorming` - Explore requirements and design
2. `/writing-plans` - Create implementation plan
3. `/test-driven-development` - Implement with TDD
4. `/requesting-code-review` - Review before completion

#### Multi-step Task
1. `/writing-plans` - Create implementation plan
2. `/test-driven-development` - Implement with TDD
3. `/requesting-code-review` - Review before completion

#### Simple Bug Fix
1. `/test-driven-development` - Implement with TDD
2. `/requesting-code-review` - Review before completion

#### Refactoring
1. `/test-driven-development` - Ensure tests cover existing behavior
2. Refactor implementation
3. `/requesting-code-review` - Review before completion

### 4. Quality Gates (Checklist Before Completion)

Every task MUST pass ALL these gates before being marked as completed:

- ✅ **Tests written first** (TDD methodology followed)
- ✅ **Tests passing** with 90%+ coverage
- ✅ **Linting without errors**
  - Backend: `poetry run ruff check .`
  - Frontend: `npm run lint` (if configured)
- ✅ **Type checking without errors**
  - Backend: `poetry run mypy app`
  - Frontend: `npm run type-check` (if configured)
- ✅ **Code review executed and approved** (`/requesting-code-review`)
- ✅ **(UI tasks only) Screenshot verified visually**

---

## Plan Status Management

ALL implementation work should be tracked in `/docs/plans/index.md`. Plan status must be updated automatically at key workflow stages.

### Plan Status Lifecycle

```
🔴 Backlog → 🟣 Ready → 🟡 In Progress → 🟢 For Review → ✅ Done
                               ↓
                          ⚫ Blocked (any stage)
```

### Automatic Status Updates

Claude automatically updates plan status at these points:

1. **After `/brainstorming`** → Register new plan as **Backlog** (🔴)
   - Design document created
   - Not yet planned for implementation

2. **After `/writing-plans`** → Update to **Ready** (🟣)
   - Implementation plan completed
   - Ready to start coding

3. **When first todo marked `in_progress`** → Update to **In Progress** (🟡)
   - Active implementation started
   - Developers working on it

4. **When ALL todos completed** → Update to **Done** (✅)
   - Implementation finished
   - All quality gates passed
   - Code reviewed and merged

5. **When blocked** → Update to **Blocked** (⚫)
   - Implementation cannot proceed
   - Waiting on dependencies, decisions, or fixes

### Manual Status Management

Use the `/update-plan-status` skill or helper script for manual updates:

```bash
# Register new plan
node scripts/update-plan-status.js --register \
  --file=2026-01-08-feature-name.md \
  --title="Feature Name" \
  --description="Brief description" \
  --status=backlog

# Update plan status
node scripts/update-plan-status.js --update \
  --file=2026-01-08-feature-name.md \
  --status=in-progress \
  --note="Started implementing API endpoints"

# List all plans
node scripts/update-plan-status.js --list
```

### Archiving Completed Plans

Plans are NOT automatically archived. Archive manually when needed:

```bash
# Archive a completed plan
./scripts/archive-plan.sh 2026-01-08-feature-name.md
```

Archived plans:
- Move to `/docs/plans/archived/`
- Remain in index.md with updated path
- Keep "Done" status with "(Archived)" note

### Integration with Quality Gates

Before marking any task as **completed**, if it's part of a plan:

- ✅ All quality gates passed (tests, linting, type checking, review)
- ✅ Plan status updated to appropriate state
- ✅ If last task of plan: Update plan to "Done"

### Best Practices

1. **One plan per feature/module** - Don't mix unrelated work
2. **Descriptive notes** - When updating status, explain why
3. **Keep index.md current** - Update status promptly, don't batch
4. **Archive old plans** - Keep active plans visible, archive completed work periodically
5. **Reference plan in commits** - Link commits to plan docs when relevant

### Tools Reference

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| `update-plan-status.js` | Update plan status | `node scripts/update-plan-status.js --help` |
| `archive-plan.sh` | Archive completed plans | `./scripts/archive-plan.sh <filename>` |
| `/update-plan-status` | Skill for automatic updates | Called automatically by Claude |

## Helper Scripts

Use the provided scripts to verify quality gates efficiently.

### Backend Quality Verification

```bash
./scripts/verify-quality-backend.sh
```

This script runs:
- All tests with coverage report
- Ruff linting
- MyPy type checking

Exit code 0 = all checks passed, non-zero = failures detected.

### Frontend Quality Verification

```bash
./scripts/verify-quality-frontend.sh
```

This script runs:
- All tests
- Linting (if configured)
- Type checking (if configured)
- Build verification

Exit code 0 = all checks passed, non-zero = failures detected.

### UI Screenshot Capture

```bash
npm run screenshot -- --url=http://localhost:5173/path
```

Captures a screenshot of the specified URL for visual verification.

4. **Completion**
   - Marks task as completed only after all gates pass

### Example 3: Refactoring Existing Code

**User Request**: "Refactor feature service to use dependency injection"

**Claude Workflow**:

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Uses `/writing-plans` to outline refactoring approach
   - Identifies affected components and tests

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Uses `/test-driven-development`
   - Delegates to claudia:
     - Ensure existing tests cover current behavior
     - Add any missing tests for edge cases
     - Refactor implementation
     - Verify all tests still pass

3. **Quality Verification Phase**
   - Runs `./scripts/verify-quality-backend.sh`
   - Verifies coverage remains at 90%+

4. **Review Phase**
   - Uses `/requesting-code-review`
   - Addresses any review feedback

5. **Completion**
   - Marks task as completed only after all gates pass

---

## Non-Compliance Protocol

Tasks that don't meet quality gates should **NOT** be marked as completed.

**Process for Blocked Tasks**:

1. **Keep task as `in_progress`** - Do not mark as completed
2. **Create new task(s)** to resolve blockers
   - Example: "Fix failing test in user service"
   - Example: "Resolve type errors in ProfilePage component"
3. **Fix issues** - Work on blocker tasks
4. **Re-run quality gates** - Verify all checks pass
5. **Only then mark as completed** - When all gates are green

**Common Blocker Examples**:
- Tests failing
- Coverage below 90%
- Linting errors
- Type checking errors
- Code review feedback not addressed
- Screenshot reveals UI issues

---

## Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum**: 90% line coverage (strict standard)
- **Target**: 95%+ line coverage
- **Measure with**:
  - Backend: `poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing`
  - Frontend: `npm run test:coverage`

### Code Quality Standards

**Backend**:
- Ruff linting: Zero errors, zero warnings
- MyPy type checking: Zero errors
- All tests passing

**Frontend**:
- ESLint (if configured): Zero errors
- TypeScript: Zero type errors
- All tests passing

### Visual Quality Standards

**UI Changes**:
- Screenshot captures expected behavior
- No visual regressions
- Responsive design verified (if applicable)
- Accessibility considerations met

---

## Tools Reference

### Testing Tools

**Backend**:
- pytest: Test framework
- pytest-asyncio: Async test support
- pytest-cov: Coverage reporting
- aiosqlite: In-memory test database

**Frontend**:
- Vitest: Test framework
- Vue Test Utils: Component testing
- jsdom: DOM environment for tests
- Playwright: E2E and screenshot testing

### Quality Tools

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
2. **Follow AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
3. **Test edge cases** and error conditions
4. **Mock external dependencies** (APIs, databases)
5. **Keep tests independent** - no shared state between tests

### TDD Red-Green-Refactor

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that defines desired behavior
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Code Review

1. **Review for correctness** - Does it solve the problem?
2. **Review for quality** - Is it maintainable?
3. **Review for performance** - Are there bottlenecks?
4. **Review for security** - Are there vulnerabilities?
5. **Review for tests** - Is coverage adequate?

---

## Notes

- This workflow applies to **ALL** code changes (features, bugs, refactoring)
- **No exceptions** - quality is not negotiable
- If quality gates fail, the task is not complete
- Screenshots should be reviewed by Claude before completing UI tasks
- Coverage threshold: **90%+ (strict standard)**
- Quality gates must pass before merge/PR creation
- All skills (`/test-driven-development`, `/requesting-code-review`, etc.) are mandatory for their respective task types

## Quick Reference

### Task Type Decision Tree

```
Is it a new feature?
├─ Yes → /brainstorming → /writing-plans → /test-driven-development → /requesting-code-review
└─ No
   └─ Is it multi-step?
      ├─ Yes → /writing-plans → /test-driven-development → /requesting-code-review
      └─ No → /test-driven-development → /requesting-code-review
```
